Battles
===================
__PocketMine Plugin__

### About

Battles allows you setup arenas for your players to fight in fair pvp matches (basically a 1v1 plugin). You can set
multiple spawn positions for each arena and one will be chosen randomly for every player before a battle,  which will
keep your players on edge.
